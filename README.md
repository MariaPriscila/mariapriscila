Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maria Priscila, a backend developer currently living in Recife, Brazil. I work with Kotlin and I'm studying Python while improving my skills in Spring. I'm also a facilitator and monitor for the programming course @Reprograma.

I like to talk about various topics, such as travel, music, REST APIs, cats, art, and poetry. In fact, a curious fact about me is that I made a career transition; I was studying to be a master's in management and worked as a leader in the financial sector before becoming a developer.
