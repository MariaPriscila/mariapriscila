    <h3>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p>I'm Maria Priscila, a backend developer currently living in Recife, Brazil. I work with Kotlin and I'm studying Python while improving my skills in Spring. I'm also a facilitator and monitor for the programming course @Reprograma.</p>

<p>I love talking about various topics, such as traveling, music, REST APIs, cats, art, and poetry. A fun fact about me is that I was studying to become a master in management/administration and worked as a finance leader before becoming a developer.</p>

<p>Here on my GitHub, you'll find many projects in progress and in different stages of development.</p>

<p>Feel free to make a pull request and collaborate with my projects.</p>

<p>You can contact me via email: <a href="mailto:pry16rocha@gmail.com">pry16rocha@gmail.com</a></p>
