### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MariaPriscila/mariapriscila** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm Maria Priscila, a backend developer currently living in Recife, Brazil. I work with Kotlin and I'm studying Python while improving my skills in Spring. I'm also a facilitator and monitor for the programming course @Reprograma.

I love talking about various topics, such as traveling, music, REST APIs, cats, art, and poetry. A fun fact about me is that I was studying to become a master in management/administration and worked as a finance leader before becoming a developer.

Here on my Github, you'll find many projects in progress and in different stages of development.

Feel free to make a pull request and collaborate with my projects.

You can contact me via email: pry16rocha@gmail.com
